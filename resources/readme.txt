For the reviewer:

This game contains a cheat difficulty, in which the player takes 0 damage and one-shots every enemy.
We recommend playing on Normal difficulty, as it gives some challenge in combat and puts some pressure on the player.
Dying in the game resets the game, so be careful with your resources and examine items enemies to plan your moves.

If you get stuck on the maze, it is mapped on the last page of the map file.  

Most importantly, have fun playing!
